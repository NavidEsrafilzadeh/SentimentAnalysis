This program collects financial news articles for several publicly traded companies for a given time frame through a web scraper. 
The program ultimately creates a chart visualizing the overall daily sentiment in the articles for a given time frame, on a
scale from -1 to 1 (where -1 is max. negativity, and 1 max. positivity).
